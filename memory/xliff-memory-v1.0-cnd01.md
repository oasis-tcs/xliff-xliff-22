# 1 Scope

\<

What is the purpose and scope of this document?
Best practices:

- Expect this text to be reused in multiple other places to explain the document in summary form.  
- This is not the TC or OP scope (which is an IPR and rules boundary);  rather, this section is the summary intended purpose of this document.  
- Short is better; four paragraphs or less is recommended.  
- If use of this spec is deliberately created to rely on or complement another standard, consider briefly mentioning that here as context.  
- To the extent that discussion of the larger context of the spec, or its history, or the circumstances that led to its creation or revision, are necessary, they belong in the Introduction, not here.
